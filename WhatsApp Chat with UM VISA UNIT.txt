I am not staying in the accomodation but I see WOW week already starting today.

10/8/22, 2:02 PM - +65 8752 4830: hi, may i know when can we submit our passport to UM visa unit? is it 75% or 80%?
10/8/22, 2:06 PM - +974 3360 6983: Good Morning, this is related to student visa/EMGS problem. I'm an Engineering undergraduate international student that is in KL. I was not able to attend yesterday meeting that's I have saw in instagram. As my EMGS is still on *35%*, I am unsure that I can attend the orientation week or the Face to Face Class mode. I have email my department before about my issues but I have not received any reply. 

Please let me know what should I do or who should contact with🙏🏻😊
10/8/22, 2:08 PM - +880 1827-064528: What is your current emgs status? Is it in progress with emgs or immigration?
10/8/22, 2:09 PM - +974 3360 6983: My status is in progress with immigration

10/8/22, 2:12 PM - +60 11-6530 3031: Same here🙂
10/8/22, 2:15 PM - +60 12-263 7043: If anything, I would recommend going to Putrajaya and the immigration departament with all proper documentation, and to double check that your application is in and that all is ok and you're in the system

Good afternoon everyone. Based on our previous meeting with the visa unit from UM, it was quite obvious that the visa delay might not be sorted out before classes start. Hence, we have created a survey to identify the students who wish to attend the classes online till their visa issues are resolved. So, please fill in this survey if you wish to attend classes online for the time being until the visa issues are resolved. 

Thank you 🙏🏽

10/9/22, 11:54 AM - +977 982-3313173: Do we have to provide declaration of online classes to Immigration Department should we wish to attend online classes, which might cause further delay?
10/9/22, 11:57 AM - Sudaarshan UM: Do fill in the survey first, as right now, we are compiling information so that we can send to the administration.

After much discourse, we have finally shortlisted two of our applicants to run as presidential candidates.

We ask you to use your vote wisely, and look forward to your attendance on Monday. Please register for it on the link provided.

10/10/22, 11:09 AM - +86 131 9133 7185: immigration office is very busy .More often than not, you can't get through.
10/10/22, 11:10 AM - +86 133 8885 1618: Wow, my visa stopped at 35
10/10/22, 11:10 AM - +974 3360 6983: Hello. I would like to ask, how long usually to get above 35% of emgs?
10/10/22, 11:10 AM - +86 133 8885 1618: 所以我注册了的，那怎么办12号就选课了
10/10/22, 11:12 AM - +86 131 9133 7185: Everyone has a different timeframe. There's no way to reference it.
10/10/22, 11:15 AM - +974 3360 6983: Oohh. Cause I heard that after my 35% turn green, I just need to wait 14 days. Is that correct?
10/10/22, 11:20 AM - +86 131 9133 7185: If your document is submitted to immigration, it will take 7 to 10 working days to reach 70%. If it's still at emgs, there's no telling how many days it will take. I suggest you can check your history.
10/10/22, 11:21 AM - +86 133 8885 1618: Omg
10/10/22, 11:21 AM - +974 3360 6983: Cause my status is in progress with immigration

10/10/22, 11:24 AM - +62 812-9163-2033: wow it means we will be late for college right ?
10/10/22, 11:24 AM - +86 131 9133 7185: Maybe you can email to emgs to ask if the document has been reviewed.And when will it be submitted to the immigration office
10/10/22, 11:25 AM - +86 131 9133 7185: That's right
10/10/22, 11:25 AM - +86 133 8885 1618: But I don't know their email address

10/10/22, 11:49 AM - +880 1732-044780: Hello, my EMGS is stuck at 15% yellow from 29 September. I was asked to resubmit my photograph and a scan copy of my passport through email (additionaldoc@emgs.com.my). The documents were sent on 29 September as well but the process hasn't progressed.
I am still awaiting the EMGS approval letter and I can't proceed for self enrolment without it. I would really appreciate it if there is something that the university can do.

I called the emgs and I was informed that due to high volume of application I should wait for upto 7-8 days (it has already been 7-8 days).

10/11/22, 11:50 AM - +880 1732-044780: Hello, my EMGS is stuck at 15% yellow from 29 September. I was asked to resubmit my photograph and a scan copy of my passport through email (additionaldoc@emgs.com.my). The documents were sent on 29 September as well but the process hasn't progressed.
I am still awaiting the EMGS approval letter and I can't proceed for self enrolment without it. I would really appreciate it if there is something that the university can do.

I called the emgs and I was informed that due to high volume of application I should wait for upto 7-8 days (it has already been 7-8 days).

Case number: 1977892
Passport numbers: A01735914
Application ID: E701095025
10/11/22, 11:53 AM - +966 54 192 5199: Will there be a possibility for students with a little bit of visa delay to attend first week of lectures online or not ? because I don’t know if I should register my courses tomorrow or will I have to wait for next semester .
Note: my visa turned to 35% today so most probably i will get my val by next week .
10/11/22, 11:55 AM - +966 54 192 5199: I think you can call them and tell them the 7-8 days has passed and ask approximately when will there be progress also ask if there is any other problems with the documents and if there is something you can do to help the visa progress again
10/11/22, 12:10 PM - Ayesha Abeer UM: I think you should raise this issue directly with on the online session on friday. I went through the same thing but I had to keep emailing alot of people to solve the problem. And please inform your course coordinator about this issue as well.

10/13/22, 1:14 PM - +86 155 7475 1593: Dear officer:
I understand university is going to make our study life came back to the previous day.(physically).
However，This visa delay is not just issues like before which have occurred. 
First，The process of emgs is slowly because of the COVID19 which more chinese Student and other intl student apply in.(from my side，study in malaysia has been widely publicized in China for the past two years) 
Second，It is the first time for all year of student (not only year1）to ask emgs to process.This is something that has never happened before.
When we are advise to take this problem to faculty by individual，some faculties may be not able to realize those and just act like before.

We sincerely hope university Will have some solution and exact study mode for us.
10/13/22, 1:26 PM - +86 156 0222 2665: And we do hope that the visa unit will work with the faculties closely to inform them with the situation that  a large amount of students are not able to return due to the delay of visa process.   It's just time-consuming and inefficient for hundreds of students  to contact faculty staff with the same issue while the staff have no answer for.

10/13/22, 4:40 PM - +880 1919-649886: Dear Firdaus,

My EMGS status is 15% yellow for past one month and I can't do my Self- Enrollment due to not having "EMGS approval letter" which the EMGS is delaying way too much. I really don't want to defer my course. Hope UM will pressurise EMGS to clear our Case faster and to provide me with "EMGS Approval letter" so that I can do my Self-Enrollment or we request UM to extend the Enrollment deadline up until EMGS is providing us with the required documents. As most things are delayed my EMGS , not by the students hope UM will consider our situation.

It's been 3-4 days my recent CASE :1980461 has been closed and there's been no update till date, please highlight our problem so that we don't miss our classes.

I am Mr. Firdaus from Visa Unit Universiti Malaya. I shared your concerns and predicaments in regards to the delay of getting your eVAL at *70%* on the EMGS application. To ease your reference, the following are some guidelines for your certain course of action:

1. You may proceed to enroll and register when you received *EMGS Approval Letter* at *15% to 35%*.

2. As some of you might be late to enter Malaysia, please kindly liaise with your respective Faculty for any possible arrangements. Any decision made by the Faculty subject to their own discretion. 

3. After receiving the eVAL at 70%, please make necessary arrangements to enter Malaysia. Apply for the SEV or eVISA to enter Malaysia. Once you arrived in Kuala Lumpur, please walk-in to the Visa Counter for further endorsement on your Student Pass. The place you should visit first is Visa Unit!!

4. In any case you may not receive your eVAL on time, it is advisable that you apply for the deferment with reference to your programme of studies. Please consult your Faculty for the procedures and detailed instructions.

Please note that the University has no control on the application process as the approval is entirely at the Immigration discretion.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

Trust these clarify.
Firdaus
10/13/22, 7:43 PM - +60 17-620 0405: Alao bear in mind that the estimated time to get the eVAL is 14 days after EMGS closes all your application issues.

I sincerely understand your situation and we apologise for the delay of your eVAL. Please take note that it is being reviewed by the Immigration Department and please expect some times for the approval from their end.

Meanwhile, for your programme of studies, it is true that all courseworks programme of studies will be face-to-face physical. In your situation, it is advisable for you to update the Faculty that you would be late in attending the lecture due to the visa matter. However, it is your sole responsibility to catch up with all lecture notes to compensate with your absent.

I wish you all the best and please do not hesitate to reach us out if you need any other assistance. Thank you.

10/13/22, 10:13 PM - +880 1815-201335: we also understand the concern of so many students spamming to many emails
10/13/22, 10:16 PM - +60 11-3384 3211: Sir, for my situation I wanna to explain more clearer.

Im progression student, my bachelor degree is UPM. The reason why I still yellow is that EMGS said my official transcript from UPM is not official. 

So I went to UPM and let them give me a supporting letter to support the transcript.

I have sent both supporting letter and transcript to UM VISA UNIT as additional documents, and waiting until now.

But actually Im also lucy because I already get Approval letter so I can enroll, the problem now is I also have to move EMGS progress to change student visa.

Sorry for such long message sir, this will be more clearer. Thanks again sir.
10/13/22, 10:19 PM - +880 1732-044780: Thank you very much. I have contacted the faculty of engineering (Madam Mawar as referred by Madam Salina). But haven't been able to hear back. I really appreciate your advice
10/13/22, 10:41 PM - +971 55 676 0684: Hi everyone

If we finish registration and pay for the courses then we are absent from lectures for two weeks or more what will happen?
There will be any refund? 
Or can we shift all courses to term 2 without issues?

I am afraid if I finish everything and don't get eval then I will be considered as "failed" in my courses.

Anything in UM laws and regulations about this issue?
10/14/22, 12:13 AM - +234 703 818 3898: @60176200405 Please I've responded to EMGS's request about clear copy of Academic certificates, and CC to ISS_AASC on 6th October 2022. But been told that EMGS's protocol only respond to cases sent by school. Please kindly acknowledge if such documents were sent through UM VISA Unit to avoid any unnecessary delay. Thanks.

My visa application is stuck at 35% yellow. It states that EMGs need additional document from institution. I have asked to AASC and they said they already collect it to EMGS, but until now there is no progress at all in my application. 

Actually, I start to process my visa since February. I have defer my study once. I hope this semester I can get my visa on time but unfortunately not. 

I hope you can help me to check my application. I'll really appreciate it. Thank you

I am Firdaus from Visa Unit. 

I truly understand your predicament in regards to the delay of getting your eVAL at 70% on the EMGS application. Hence, I have prepared some guidelines for you to refer to below.

1. For those who are receiving the *EMGS Approval Letter* at 15% to 35%, you may proceed to enroll and register yourself. Your are allowed to do that at this stage. There is no excuse if you are not to register or enroll. 

2. We allow you to study online up to week 3. Please contact your respective faculties regarding this matter to request for online mode of study and further arrangements on your studies.

* If your visa is not proccessed on time, you are advised to defer your study to the next available semesters. Semester II 2022/2023 (February/March Intake) or Semester I 2023/2024 (September/October Intake).

* Also, please bear in mind that the estimated time to get the eVAL is 14 days after EMGS closes all your application issues.

3. After receiving the eVAL at 70%, please make the necessary arrangements to enter Malaysia. Apply for the SEV or eVISA to enter Malaysia. Once you have entered, please come to the Visa Counter for further endorsement on your Student Pass. The place you should visit first is Visa Unit.

Please note that the University has no control on the application process as the approval is entirely at the Immigration discretion.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

1. You may proceed to enroll and register when you received *EMGS Approval Letter* at *15% to 35%*.

2. As some of you might be late to enter Malaysia, please kindly liaise with your respective Faculty for any possible arrangements. Any decision made by the Faculty subject to their own discretion. 

3. After receiving the eVAL at 70%, please make necessary arrangements to enter Malaysia. Apply for the SEV or eVISA to enter Malaysia. Once you arrived in Kuala Lumpur, please walk-in to the Visa Counter for further endorsement on your Student Pass. The place you should visit first is Visa Unit!!

4. In any case you may not receive your eVAL on time, it is advisable that you apply for the deferment with reference to your programme of studies. Please consult your Faculty for the procedures and detailed instructions.

Please note that the University has no control on the application process as the approval is entirely at the Immigration discretion.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

But now the claim just changed all of a sudden. We desperately need to go to Malaysia and study, none of us want to defer the study.

10/14/22, 3:08 PM - +86 178 2544 7980: I’ve rent a house already and it’s not refundable... So I cannot accept to defer the study😿
10/14/22, 3:08 PM - +60 16-481 4981: So can we have online courses for two to three weeks?
10/14/22, 3:09 PM - +60 16-481 4981: We haven’t get our evisa yet.

10/14/22, 3:10 PM - +86 131 5316 2067: It’s no fair to us, visa delays isn’t our responsibility and “personal reason “
10/14/22, 3:10 PM - +86 156 0222 2665: The only reason I pay for the tuition fee yesterday is that you clarify there'll be 3 weeks online course for transition. And all of the sudden, no online course.
10/14/22, 3:10 PM - +86 178 2544 7980: Yes! Mine as well
10/14/22, 3:10 PM - +62 856-5742-2393: with due all of respect, that is correct lots of us has plan with our career imagine have to wait to achieve it for 6 months, the problem does not come from us and we are the one has to suffer?

10/14/22, 3:11 PM - +60 16-481 4981: What if there are no online courses?😭
10/14/22, 3:11 PM - +91 73073 67638: Please sir , 

Arrange Online classes for just 2-3 weeks . Most of us can’t defer . My visa has been delayed because university did not submit Declaration of Accomodation for a month . That was not because of “ personal reason “ . It was more of a fault at University’s Visa Department.
10/14/22, 3:12 PM - +60 16-481 4981: That is what I want to say
10/14/22, 3:12 PM - +86 132 9450 5362: Me too
10/14/22, 3:13 PM - +62 812-3404-2106: I think it is better if we ask for online classes during this semester since there is no guarantee that our visa matter could completed in 3 weeks
10/14/22, 3:14 PM - +62 895-6203-05272: I agree
10/14/22, 3:14 PM - +86 132 9450 5362: As for me，I was
10/14/22, 3:14 PM - +62 812-1149-6566: I agree with this sir
10/14/22, 3:14 PM - +62 812-3404-2106: *at least
10/14/22, 3:14 PM - +86 178 2544 7980: To be honest, the offer given by the university was late enough and the EMGS processed our application veryy slowly... Now my visa is nearly finished just need a week or two
10/14/22, 3:14 PM - +86 189 7260 2466: Dear Sir/Madam:                             Many facilities don’t offer online classes for us,can you help us to ask for online classes?I’m from the faculty of business and economics,（BBA）
10/14/22, 3:14 PM - +86 178 2544 7980: Just a few weeks online classes
10/14/22, 3:15 PM - +60 16-481 4981: We really need time to solve the problems ,even though it’s not our fault 😢
10/14/22, 3:15 PM - +62 813-6032-1670: i already ask and for this time they only have physical class and ask the one who can’t attent to do deferment
10/14/22, 3:15 PM - +62 895-1020-3793: *This is so true*, no one can guarantee us. We cannot accept just 3 weeks of online classes if we do not know when the VISA application finish.
10/14/22, 3:15 PM - +60 16-481 4981: I have sent emails but there is no reply
10/14/22, 3:16 PM - +62 812-1149-6566: FASS doesnt offer online classes aswell for students that are going to arrive late due to visa issues. If I may say, it's clearly not our fault because we have completed the required documents on time. It's due of the late responses from UM's visa unit and also the EMGS.
10/14/22, 3:16 PM - +86 156 0222 2665: I agree

10/14/22, 4:21 PM - +86 156 2319 7750: Since I can't join in the meeting, here's what I want to say:
1. Source of the problem: The visa processing is too slow and the evisa system remian maintenance, and the repair time is unknown.  In fact, we international students are paying for the mistakes of others, that's not fair.
2. Our request: We didn't require the online course for whole semester, but we just needed a little transition time for us to complete the visa process. 
3.Communication with the school: International students have been actively contacting the facility and visa department to find solutions, but the facility ignores our emails  and does not consider our actual situation(eg: our facility think once we got eval we can come to malaysia). Hope they can respond positively to students' demands and give reasonable solutions.
4.So far, our problems have not been reasonably solved, let alone received a reply from our point of view.As the best university in Malaysia, I hope that the school will take the demands of our international students seriously.
10/14/22, 4:24 PM - +62 812-3404-2106: This problem is involving another parties that out of Univ Malaya' s control, I think
10/14/22, 4:24 PM - +86 155 1168 7268: I'll give you a biiiiig '👍'

Our faculty （faculty of arts and social sciences）thinks that with eval, we can enter the country for classes immediately.Therefore, our faculty determines not to let us take online classes.But as you know, the visa system is not satisfactory recently.This means that we will miss class and fail,if the teacher doesn't understand.
There are many misunderstandings in the middle.And we didn't get a response until we emailed the explanation.

So I hope the visa unit to make some explanation to our faculty why we might be late, not because we didn't go on purpose.

10/14/22, 5:42 PM - +86 130 0635 7767: It seems that this is not a common phenomenon.UM needs attention.

I tried to check my application using my initial application number that obtained last year when applied on first semester. But I found that my application has reached 100%. I doubt that the status is valid. Could you provide me with the applicable way to check my latest request? Thank you

How should I proceed if I want the university to send the document (as a backup)?

10/16/22, 2:56 PM - +86 133 8885 1618: I sent them an email to apply for online courses, but I haven't replied yet
10/16/22, 2:59 PM - +880 1842-633322: Did you show some kind of evidence for your delay to get that?
10/16/22, 3:00 PM - +880 1842-633322: Also, do you need to enter Malaysia within this timeframe?
10/16/22, 3:01 PM - +86 178 2544 7980: I did show my visa status and my enrollment information.

10/16/22, 3:08 PM - +86 133 8885 1618: Do you have any visa changes these days?
10/16/22, 3:08 PM - +880 1842-633322: I also wonder if they're gonna let us sit for classes without paying the fees.
Although, a senior from CS faculty said that it’s okay to pay tuition fees bofore semester finals

10/16/22, 3:14 PM - +880 1842-633322: Though this isn’t the place to ask this🥲

10/18/22, 7:01 PM - +86 156 0222 2665: Evening Sir, @60176200405 my visa was 35 yellow on OCT 3rd when EMGS required the institution to submit a latest offer. UM submited to the EMGS on Oct 5th and we heard nothing from the EMGS since then.  I called them on OCT 13th and they said the offer is received but they need time to review.  But when I e-mail them yesterday they said they are still pending for the institution to submit. I'm so confused here. Could you please help me check?

I am worried that I will delay many courses or miss the exam. First I would like to know how to speed up the processing, after all, my case is more complex. Secondly, I would like to know whether it is possible to go to and stay in Malaysia temporarily with a tourist visa. After obtaining val, I can apply for a visa or directly submit my passport to obtain a student pass. Is that all right? Looking forward to your reply. My most heartfelt thanks!
各位同学们晚上好。我现在遇到一个情况。因为我更新了护照，所以需要和emgs更新信息以获得Val.我担心因此耽误很多课程或错过考试。首先我想知道通过什么方式可以加快处理速度，毕竟我的情况更复杂。其次我想知道能否通过旅游签证暂时前往并停留在马来西亚，获得val后再办理一个签证或直接提交护照来获得student pass。请问这样是否可以？期待您的回复。万分感谢！

It has been more than a month after applying for student visa and i have only received EMGS approval letter 2-3 weeks back. After that on 11th of this month, EMGS updated the status saying eVAL will take 7-10 days for the approval.

 I send a email to EMGS later on 22nd regarding any update. Next day, i received an update that my application was approved by the immigration department however the eVAL is pending for course name review and asked me to give them time and they will review the eVAL and update accordingly.

What can I do at this point?
10/25/22, 9:39 AM - +62 856-5742-2393: Good Morning Mr. @60176200405 

i hope you find this message well. My visa application is currently at 32%. It is currently requesting *Declaration of Online Classes*, i already sent my academic result from sem 1-4 since 2 weeks ago to mr Syahmi cc Mrs Liza and i emailed the visa unit again last week and mentioning that they will act accordingly but my application has not yet updated. Im hoping that you can help me regarding this matter knowing that some lecturers only gives us 3 weeks to finish our visa application.

Thank You. Regards.

10/25/22, 6:58 PM - +91 82871 76731: At 35% , you generally receive the EMGS approval letter at EMGS portal. After that, the institute is required to submit your Declaration of accommodation, which is a form available on the AASD website that you need to fill and submit the uni. Then it takes about half a month, could be more or less to get to 70%, where you get the E-VAL. Finally you arrive in Malaysia, get your student card and application concludes with 100%. This process is for UG, not sure about PG. But you can contact your faculty head through email to get to know more or again go to their website (AASD) to check out the whole visa process, (there is a pdf). Hope this helps you or any other student. Just a little advice from a fellow applicant. 
Cheers!

Greetings, could you please highlight and check on my visa application? It's been a month and a half since my process stuck at 35% yellow colour. EMGS demanded a new offer because they considered the one UM submitted on October 5th was back-dated. I called several times but no progress has been made. The GSB will not grant any online classes after week 7 and I really need to be in KL soon. Please help me with this matter. Thank you.

Greetings from Chen Qianqian, a PhD student from the Faculty of Languages and Linguistics (Student ID: s2142469, Passport No.: EE7523307).

My eVal expired, and I sent you all the materials except a confirmation letter half a month ago. I had been working on getting the confirmation letter from the faculty these days and I got it just now.

A few minutes ago, I attached all the materials needed for eVal extension to a email sent to you for your reference. Thank you very much! Should I get your reply after sending you the materials to make sure that you will process my extension materials?

Best Regards,
Chen Qianqian

12/21/22, 11:10 AM - +62 812-3404-2106: if I not mistaken based on the previous information, if your progress has been reached 97%, you are able to pick up the passport at visa unit... you need to check the list at AASD website first whether your passport has been ready
12/21/22, 11:16 AM - +86 187 8332 3075: @60176200405 hello, can you help me update my status, It has been stopped at 97% for 2 weeks

12/21/22, 11:23 AM - +60 17-620 0405: The percentage should be 100%
12/21/22, 11:23 AM - +60 17-620 0405: For passport collection
12/21/22, 11:38 AM - +86 187 8332 3075: @60176200405You mean my passport can be collected now?
12/21/22, 12:17 PM - +62 812-3404-2106: I wonder where is the passport location when the progress reaches 97%,since EMGS said that it is ready to collected
12/21/22, 12:27 PM - +60 11-3600 9570: it is ready to be collected by the university, not by the student
12/21/22, 12:29 PM - +62 812-3404-2106: So I think that the university later will set the percentage into 100% then we can take the passport at the university
12/21/22, 12:29 PM - +60 11-3600 9570: yes 💯
12/21/22, 12:32 PM - +62 812-3404-2106: If there are some people who have been experiencing their percentage is 97% for about two weeks, where is the potential problem?
12/21/22, 2:58 PM - +86 19908116047: hello, sir. May I ask when the school will go to emgs to get back our passports? My emgs have been at 97% for a long time… @60176200405

My EMGS status had reached 97% on the 12/12/2022, but unfortunately it has not moved to 100% even after multiple days.

After reaching 97%, I recieved mails from EMGS on 22/12/2022 stating my Personal Bond issue had been solved and closed, but I did not receive any mail after that.

Kindly inform me as to when I could expect to receive my passport from EMGS.

Good evening sir,

My name is Bao Tianxin
Student ID: s2162810
Passport No: E69820841

I have submitted my passport on 27/10 for new student visa, and later submitted again with special pass on 3/11, but for the past 2 months, I haven't received any updates and it’s still at 80%. When will the visa unit submit my passport to the EMGS?

Thank you

12/30/22, 10:17 PM - Ayesha Abeer UM: 🚨 IMPORTANT 🚨

Good Evening everyone, 

I want to bring your attention to a missing backpack lost by a student on the UM shuttle bus route D. He took the 7pm bus from UM central on 30/12/22 with his bag and forgot his bag on the bus as he got off at international house. He went to the bus parking at the end of the route to check if his bag was in the bus but it wasn't there so there is a possibility that someone took it.

The bag details are as follows:
Universiti Malaya MHS kit bag (black bag with UM logo) 

The contents of the bag are:
Apple Macbook
Apple Ipad with a doraemon sticker
Plain black tshirt 
Apple charger 

 Please guys if you've accidentally taken a bag that fits this description or might have come across it, contact:

Please check with your friends as well and share this message. It would be appreciated if you could spread the word as much as you can and help him out. 

Thank you 🙏🏼

1/8/23, 10:44 PM - +60 17-620 0405: Currently, we are waiting for your Special Pass to be endorsed and for your information, it usually takes up to 3-4 weeks. 

After the endorsement procedure is done, we will submit your passport for the Student Pass endorsement.

It is estimated that you will have to wait for another 2 weeks for it to be ready.

I went to the visa counter 20+ days before my visa expired and they made me apply for a special pass.
5/22/23, 7:17 PM - UM Visa Unit Hotline: Auch, sorry for the confusion.

All rewenal application should be submitted 3 months before the expiry date.

And once EMGS requests to submit the passport at 50%, the validity of the current visa should be 10 working days and above. Otherwise, must pay the Special Pass fee.
5/22/23, 7:18 PM - Ayesha Abeer UM: But for me it was more than 10 working days
5/22/23, 7:20 PM - UM Visa Unit Hotline: then?
5/22/23, 7:20 PM - UM Visa Unit Hotline: you need the SP?
5/22/23, 7:21 PM - Ayesha Abeer UM: No, the people at the counter told me to pay for the pass when i didn't need it since I had more than 10 days before my visa expired.
5/22/23, 7:22 PM - Ayesha Abeer UM: And i did end up getting it.
5/22/23, 7:26 PM - +60 11-2852 5571: 3 months means that I should submit the documents before 3 months.like my expires date is 8 Dec,so I should submit documents before 8 Oct,but at this time,i don’t have to submit my passport right?

Would you please help me check this emgs application? Print Order # E701136299

In the morning,the status is 5% with yellow (waiting for um visa unit approval) . But now,this application number missed. He only can track his older application for previous institutions by using his passport number,and the status shows 100% with green. It’s so weird 😧

His passport number is EG6417376.

10/18/23, 10:08 AM - +60 10-397 2762: @60192492060 Good morning officer, I just sent the e-mail to you and ask your kind favor to help me to expedite the renewal process, would you please check the email and help to forward to EMGS ASAP? I really need the passport urgently, and here is the email topic for your easy search: 
Request for Expediting Visa Renewal Process-700364040.
Thank you very much.
10/18/23, 1:16 PM - +84 32 531 9423: Hi! I also have a problem with my EMGS status. My applicant number is E701129397. I submitted my passport (and required documents) on Oct 9th but EMGS still sends me reminder email to submit my passport.
10/18/23, 1:19 PM - +60 10-397 2762: @60192492060 I have sent the official invitation letter via email, would you please help to check and forward to EMGS at your earliest convenience? Thank you very much.
10/18/23, 2:50 PM - UM Visa Unit Hotline: General note to all especially new students, we will submit your passport to EMGS 3-5 days before the expiry date of your current pass
10/18/23, 3:08 PM - +62 822-2356-3939: Why we should waiting until 3 days before expiration date?
10/18/23, 3:11 PM - UM Visa Unit Hotline: there are some processes at our end before we submit students' passport
10/18/23, 3:11 PM - +62 822-2356-3939: Base on your statement the we should submit to Visa unit 10 days after airport stamp, that means the expiration date is 10 days after the stamp, isn't it? So if we enter to Malaysia on 5th October 2023, we should submit at 15 October 2023. Isn't it?
10/18/23, 3:12 PM - UM Visa Unit Hotline: look at your expiry date
10/18/23, 3:12 PM - UM Visa Unit Hotline: should be submitted 10 days before expiry date

10/26/23, 4:49 PM - +60 16-326 1682: Hello @60192492060, I want to ask for the extension of the student visa, can I do 2 months before the expiration date? As my visa will expire on *March 22, 2024*. But, my passport also will be expired on Sept 2024. So, I must extend my passport first in the Indonesian embassy. But, my schedule to the embassy will be on *January 10, 2024*, as of the full booked of the embassy. So, my new passport probably will be issued around January 20-ish, then I can proceed with the renewal for visa

10/27/23, 8:21 AM - +86 186 3977 1597: Good morning @60192492060. I was wondering whether you could give me a favor. 
I am a PhD student of the Faculty of Accounting. I have submitted the materials requested for the renewal of my Visa, but the color of my application status has become yellow. According to the comment of EMGS, the course name on IM55 is [DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY (BUSINESS)]. However, based on the STARS system/VAL, the course stated on the student's IM14 form is [DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY (FACULTY OF BUSINESS AND ACCOUNTANCY)]. The course on the student's academic result is [Faculty of Business and Economics]. The institute is required to reconfirm the course name. Would you be so kind as to guide me through the process? Many thanks in advance.

12/21/23, 11:09 AM - +60 11-2887 3349: However.I visited visa unit yesterday. I completed all required documentation for the new dependent pass, and the EMGS application is at 45%. However, yesterday at the university, the visa unit couldn't accept passports due to its validity (less than 10 days). I requested visa unit to accept my dependent passport as I've fulfilled all requirements and without an extension, my dependents may have to return, but due to validation issue not processed.I need to retain my family till the time and need way forward. <This message was edited>

12/21/23, 11:30 AM - +60 12-263 7043: If passport expire need to re-new, what did visa unit say? Didn’t they say to go embassy to renew passport?
12/21/23, 11:33 AM - +60 11-2887 3349: Yes. But immigration didnot renew the visa.
12/21/23, 11:33 AM - +60 12-263 7043: They cannot renew visa on an expired passport so best to go embassy today and tell them you want a new passport and to renew passport

Any consequences such as overstaying will be on
your own responsibility.

I've asked them to amend this and yet they haven't replied to my emails yet. It's been 2 weeks.

Do I proceed with the confirmation letter I have with me? Will it affect how many months' visa I'll get? I don't want to unnecessarily apply for visa 2 times in one year.

Happy holiday! 
I have a question about passport renewal and visa transfer. 
I will renew my passport on 8th Jan 2024 in Indonesia. However, I am only able to come to malaysia for visa transfer in the end of 22 January 2024 since I got emergency things to do in Indonesia. 
Would that be okay?

12/28/23, 1:08 PM - Showherda Ad-Din: @60192492060 about the MDAC form, it mentions that after re-entering Malaysia on an existing pass, we don't need to apply for the MDAC. So students who got their passes once and re-entered Malaysia don't need to get MDAC? And what if someone renewed their pass? I went to my country with my previous pass and re-entered with the same. Do I need to apply for one? And new students or even old students who never re-entered Malaysia, do they need to apply for MDAC? <This message was edited>
12/28/23, 1:09 PM - Showherda Ad-Din: I am referring to this clause: Existing international students who have been issued a student pass are not required to complete the MDAC if they exit and re-enter the country while their student pass is still active.

1/19/24, 10:11 AM - +62 815-1826-165: No. I asked the requirement for international PhD student to stay in Malaysia in total 1 year during their study.
1/19/24, 10:12 AM - +62 815-1826-165: Does it still a requirement for the student who is taking their study during the Covid time?
1/19/24, 10:15 AM - +62 815-1826-165: I got to know this requirement when I first came to take my 1st semester in UM. So I started to collect my visit but then the Covid procedure was not allowed us to encounter in Malaysia quite long time. So I don’t think I will be able to collect the 1 year stay once I graduate.
1/19/24, 10:18 AM - +60 12-263 7043: So you are graduating when? And you are asking if you have to have 1 year stay in Malaysia when you already did a semester or two outside of Malaysia, correct or not?
1/19/24, 10:29 AM - +62 815-1826-165: Does it still a requirement for international PhD student to stay 1 year in total in Malaysia? If not anymore, then it’s ended my question.
1/19/24, 11:18 AM - +60 14-523 2437: Hi @60192492060 , I have another question regarding this. 

So basically I planned to extend my visa next month (either at the end of February or March). Can I just wait till next month to transfer my visa to the new passport, together with the visa renewal? So I dont need to do the transfer endorsement right now.

I also dont have any plans to go outside Malaysia in the next few months, anyway.

If it is possible, please let me know. Thanks!
1/19/24, 11:37 AM - +60 12-263 7043: After studies or during studies? Because if you are finishing this semester and you didn’t stay in Malaysia for 1 year it’s ok because it’s due to covid <This message was edited>

2/7/24, 1:03 PM - +49 176 57826559: Hello everyone!

My postgraduate studies at UM are scheduled to commence on March 1st.
I just got my eVisa approved and am excited to finally come to Malaysia.
I just wanted to make sure that I am now allowed to enter KL (Feb 18)? 
Do I have to further arrange my arrival at KLIA with UM staff to clear the immigration?

Thank you!!
2/7/24, 1:31 PM - +60 12-263 7043: Hi Tobi, no arrival arrangements needed as long as you have your visa in order as well as your passport. Please make sure you bring at least couple of hundred ringgit cash and on card and that you already have transportation through grab or train or bus to your residence. In regards to UM VISA Unit staff guidelines, they advice to come 1 week before semester stars, but if it’s a few days earlier I do not think this will be an issue 😅
2/7/24, 1:39 PM - +49 176 57826559: Okay thanks a lot for the info! 
I was asking because of this slide that is part of a presentation which is provided on the UM website and details the visa process

2/7/24, 2:45 PM - +60 12-263 7043: Hi Shahroze, so far no updates due to the exam period not finishing yet and after exams the faculty student representatives are discussing how to implement this at the faculty level to ensure that it is implemented as smoothly as possible. I will update on this as soon as I receive any updates.
2/7/24, 2:52 PM - +60 12-263 7043: To the best of my knowledge, I have been approached with this exact question multiple times this semester and UM Visa stated that no representative is needed from UM which is contrary to those EMGS guidelines but has not caused a problem.
2/7/24, 2:57 PM - +49 176 57826559: Okay, thank you very much!

If you have submitted your student pass renewal application last 3 weeks and your application still not moving or still at 0% on EMGS app, pls let us know ASAP. Perhaps there is pending additional payment imposed by the EMGS due to 8% SST. 

Thank you.

Dear Visa Office,

The status of my EMGS application for student pass renewal is 50% ( EMGS is awaiting the submission of your passport to process your Student Pass).

I have submitted my renewal documents on 13 February 2024.


I am currently outside Malaysia.

My student pass will expire on 23rd May 2024.

My question is :

1. Can i submit my passport on 5  May 2024 ?

2. How many days it usually takes after passport submission till renewal?

Thank you
3/7/24, 10:17 PM - UM Visa Unit Hotline: 1. can

Dear Officer😊, my name is Meng Tao. I submitted the visa renewal materials last Tuesday, but because my evisa was not valid, the passport was only returned to me that day and allowed me to re-enter. I submitted my passport yesterday after re-entering the country. I wanted to ask if it went smoothly? What else do I need to do? I'm worried that there might be a misunderstanding if I didn't explain it clearly at the counter yesterday.

I would like to ask if it is possible to renew my visa four months in advance? My situation is that my visa will expire on October 13th, and I am not going to come to school next semester, the data collection work is carried out in China, so I would like to renew my visa before July if possible and then return to China. @60192492060
